                My laptop took a picture, at random, daily for the first month of school. Throughout the month, I visited my friends, ordered Memphis Minnie's, completed my 1500 piece puzzle, walked up many stairs around campus, saw Mean Girls in theatres, studied Paul Gauguin, and ate many apples. Here are some of my thoughts on the Internet!

            I typically use the Internet to do my homework, scroll through social media, communicate with friends, read books, or to watch movies and TV online. To complete my assignments, I often use Google Suites, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Canva, or Visual Studio Code. In my free time, I visit frequently visit Pinterest for outfit, design, and crafting inspiration. This mood-boarding app is a safe haven on the web for self-expression and discovery. However, when I'm not scrolling through social media, I am watching shows on streaming sites, reading books on the Kindle app, or I am messaging friends through Instagram and iMessage.

            My ideal internet would be a colorful and somewhat chaotic bulletin board of intersecting personalities. The web could be a outlet for people to express themselves and connect with others. Currently, there is a simultaneous commercialization of online spaces and push for authenticity from brands and individuals. As we become more disillusioned with social media platforms, I look forward to a place where authenticity is more broadly celebrated. The internet is more than a platform for publishing false personas and spreading hate or misinformation. Rather, it grants people the opportunity to learn from others, spread joy and support, and to share art and culture.

            I had finally completed my 1500 piece puzzle that I had been working on for about a month. Excited and getting ready for bed, I scrolled through Pinterest searching for inspiration for the next day's outfit.

        <p>Explore the outdoors, view my other work! In <a href="https://sylvimota.github.io/touching-grass/">"Touching Grass"</a> my visual communications class was encouraged to take a walk outside and take photos of our journey. During an outing to Balmy Alley in Mission Dolores for Valentine's Day, I took photos as my friends and I walked around. I find that I feel most at peace when I am in nature -- surrounded by greenery, flora, and art. While I scroll through social media often, I do not post much, publicly. Though I have hopes for the future of the internet, I do not yet feel the most comfortable posting to wide audiences. Online, people are able to create personas and shape how others view them. In contrast, in person it is more difficult be unauthentic. Additionally, I find that I am more observant in reality than I am when scrolling on a phone or computer. <a href="https://sylvimota.github.io/touching-grass/">"Touching Grass"</a> provides a peak into a day in my life and each of the small wonders I felt compelled to capture.</p>
